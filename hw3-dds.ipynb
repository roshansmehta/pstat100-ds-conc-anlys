    "> Most states in the USA provide services and support to individuals with developmental disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, autism, etc.) and their families. The agency through which the State of California serves the developmentally-disabled population is the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) ... One of the responsibilities of DDS is to allocate funds that support over 250,000 developmentally-disabled residents. A number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. This finding was the catalyst for further investigation; subsequently, state legislators and department managers sought consulting services from a statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll analyze the deidentified DDS data published with this article to answer the question: *is there evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in allocation of DDS funds?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside**: The JSE article focuses on what's known as [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), an arithmetic phenomenon in which aggregate trends across multiple groups show the *opposite* of within-group trends. We won't emphasize this topic, though the data does provide a nice illustration -- if you're interested in learning more, you can follow the embedded link to the Wikipedia entry on the subject.\n",

The majority of those in the 22-50 cohort no longer live with their parents but may still receive some support from their family.

    "## 2. Regression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've thoroughly explored the data, you'll use a linear model in this part to estimate the differences in median expenditure that you observed graphically in part 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you'll model the log of expenditures (response variable) as a function of gender, age cohort, and ethnicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log\\left(\\text{expend}_i\\right)\n",
    "    = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\left(\\text{6-12}\\right)_i + \\cdots + \\beta_5\\left(\\text{51+}\\right)_i + \\beta_6\\text{male}_i + \\beta_7\\text{hispanic}_i + \\cdots + \\beta_{13}\\text{other}_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, *all* of the explanatory variables are categorical and encoded using indicators; in this case, the linear model coefficients capture means for each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because this model is a little different than the examples you've seen so far in two respects -- the response variable is log-transformed and all explanatory variables are categorical -- some comments are provided below on these features. You can review or skip the comments, depending on your level of interest in understanding the model better mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commments about parameter interpretation\n",
    "In particular, each coefficient represents a difference in means from the 'baseline' group. All indicators are zero for a white male recipient between ages 0 and 5, so this is the baseline group and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\left(\\log(\\text{expend})\\;|\\; \\text{male, white, 0-5}\\right) = \\beta_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the expected log expenditure for a hispanic male recipient between ages 0 and 5 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\left(\\log(\\text{expend})\\;|\\; \\text{male, hispanic, 0-5}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_7$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $\\beta_7$ is *the difference in mean log expenditure between hispanic and white recipients after accounting for gender and age*. The other parameters have similar interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the calculation shown above may seem a little foreign, you should know that the parameters represent marginal differences in means between genders (holding age and ethnicity fixed), between ages (holding gender and ethnicity fixed), and between ethnicities (holding age and gender fixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments about the log transformation\n",
    "The response in this model is the *log* of expenditures (this gives a better model for a variety of reasons). The statistical assumption then becomes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(\\text{expend})_i \\sim N\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i'\\beta, \\sigma^2\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the log of a random variable $Y$ is normal, then $Y$ is known as a *lognormal* random variable; it can be shown mathematically that the exponentiated mean of $\\log Y$ is the median of $Y$. As a consequence, according to our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{median}(\\text{expend}_i) = \\exp\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_i'\\beta\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work on the log scale throughout to avoid complicating matters, but know that this model for the log of expenditures is *equivalently* a model of the median expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reordering categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below reorders the category levels to match the model written above. To ensure the parameters appear in the proper order, this reordering is done for you."

    "*The DDS data in this homework contains observations of individuals of all different ages, genders, and ethnic backgrounds, and we were tasked with investigating the available data to see if there was evidence discrimination with how funds were allocated. The variables in this dataset include those mentioned previously, as well as expenditure amount, an ID varable,and 'Age Cohort' which is a range of ages that a person will fall into. This is also a random sample, because of course we are not given data on all 250,000+ people that funds are given to, and there is nothing specific as to the individuals in the dataset that we have for being included. As seen in the exploratory plots, spending tends to increase from age 0 - 22, where after that it stays relatively contstant. We also see that there are age differences across the age groups, but the median spending is about the same for each ethnic group, when accounting for the ones that have a sizeable amount of data. To analyze the data, multiple linear regression techniques were used as well as charting and data manipulation. Overall, after inspecting the data and creating several plots, we can clearly see that the data does not provide any evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in the allocation of DDS funds The amount recieved is soley dependent upon individuals age.*"
