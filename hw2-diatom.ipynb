    "## Background: diatoms and paleoclimatology\n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms are a type of phytoplankton -- they are photosynthetic algae that function as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Diatoms are at the bottom of the food web: they are consumed by filter feeders, like clams, mussels, and many fish, which are in turn consumed by larger organisms like scavengers and predators and, well, us. As a result, changes in the composition of diatom species in marine ecosystems have ripple effects that can dramatically alter overall community structure in any environment of which marine life forms a part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms have glass bodies. As a group of organisms, they display a great diversity of body shapes, and many are quite elaborate. The image below, taken from a Scientific American article, shows a small sample of their shapes and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='figures/diatoms-sciam.jpg' style='width:400px'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are made of glass, diatoms preserve extraordinarily well over time. When they die, their bodies sink and form part of the sediment. Due to their abundance, there is a sort of steady rain of diatoms forming part of the sedimentation process, which produces sediment layers that are dense with diatoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedimentation is a long-term process spanning great stretches of time, and the deeper one looks in sediment, the older the material. Since diatoms are present in high density throughout sedimentation layers, and they preserve so well, it is possible to study their presence over longer time spans -- potentially hundreds of thousands of years. \n",
    "\n",
    "A branch of paleoclimatology is dedicated to studying changes in biological productivity on geologic time scales, and much research in this area has involved studying the relative abundances of diatoms. In this assignment, you'll do just that on a small scale and work with data from sediment cores taken in the gulf of California at the location indicated on the map:\n",

In sediment cores, depth correlates with time before the present -- deeper layers are older -- and depths are typically chosen to obtain a desired temporal resolution.

    "    + *Notice*: that the first difference is NaN, because there is no previous value to compare the first row with. Drop this entry when you store `diffs`.\n",

    "There are a disproportionately large number of zeroes, because in many samples no *Azpeitia nodulifer* diatoms were observed. This is a common phenomenon in ecological data, and even has a name: it results in a 'zero inflated' distribution of values. The statistician to identify and name the phenomenon was Diane Lambert, whose highly influential work on the subject (>4k citations) was published in 1992.\n",

    "Zero inflation can present a variety of challenges. You may have noticed, for example, that there was no bandwidth parameter for the KDE curve that *both* captured the shape of the histogram near zero *and* away from zero -- it either got the height near zero right but was too wiggly, or got the shape away from zero right but was too low near zero."

    "Follow these steps to construct a scatterplot of the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Altair chart based on `projected_data` and use `.transform_calculate(...)` to define a variable `since_11KyrBP` that indicates whether `Age` is older than 11,000 years. Store the result as `base`.\n",
    "2. Modify `base` to add points with the following encodings. \n",
    "    + Pass PC1 to the `X` encoding channel and title the axis 'A. Nodulifer/non-A. nodulifer composition'.\n",
    "    + Pass PC2 to the `Y` encoding channel and title the axis 'Complex community composition'.\n",
    "    + Pass the variable you created in step 1. to the `color` encoding channel and title it 'More recent than 11KyrBP'.\n",
    "    Store the result as `scatter`.\n",
    "    \n",

We can see that for the blue values, they tend to go much higher than those of the orange ones whcih represent the communites after 11,000 years ago. There is also a much bigger range for the blue ones, further indicating that there was a lot more different types of ecological communities that could be found. As such, the variation in the community composition does indeed seem to differ between the two time periods. The orange values seem to stay in a different range of values, and seem to go more horizontal, while the blue goes a bit more vertical. This indicates that there was less complex communites and more of the same ones found more often. There aren't any very high values which is different than the blue."
